### Security Brief
Security is a primary focus for the Risky Ape game. All standard online security protocols will be followed. As well as this we have identified some key downsides to other projects that we want to solve: 

Most projects refuse to make their source code open-source, often citing 'security issues' as the reason for this. We take the opposite approach in that all of our code will be open-source meaning that we are 100% transparent. This also means that we are contributing to the Solana ecosystem by providing other teams with a foundation they can work on.
We will be using true random number generation sourced through https://random.org/. This means that game results cannot be predicted, unlike games which use a pseudorandom data source. 
All game results are going to be stored on-chain forever. This means that every round of Risky Game that is played can be easily checked by anyone. Once our game is built we intend to make a site where all game data can be examined with charts and data visualization tools.

When it comes to security, there can be no compromises. If you have an ideas to help improve our security even further send @RiskyDev a dm on Discord.
